      <h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>
      <p>
        Switzerland is a small mountainous country located in central Europe.
        This landlocked country is about the size of New Jersey and is between
        France and Italy. It is also bordered by Austria, Germany, and
        Liechtenstein.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most of the population lives in the plateau which is between the high
        Alps in the south and the Jura mountains in the north. The mountainous
        area in the south is sparsely populated.
